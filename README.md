My own stack-based programming language inspired by Porth.
<br><br>

- A stack based programming language created in Python.
- It compiles to assembly, then the compiler uses NASM (the Netwide Assembler) to assemble it down to machinecode. Because convenience, the compiler generates and links an ELF64 binary.
- The file extension for Stackthon is '.skth'.
