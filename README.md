# Stackthon
My own stack-based programming language inspired by Porth.
<br><br>
### What to know?
- A stack based programming language created in Python.
- It compiles to assembly, then the compiler uses NASM (the Netwide Assembler) to assemble it down to machinecode.
- Because convenience, the compiler generates and links an ELF64 binary. In the future tho, I plan to add an OS detection system, and create the corresponding executable.
- The file extension for Stackthon is '.skth'.
